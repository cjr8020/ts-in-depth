# ts-in-depth

## udemy understanding typescript


### To run the project:

So now with weback, you need to run two commands:

    1.  To build the bundle:

```
$ npm run build

> ts-in-depth@1.0.0 build /home/craiskin/ws/ts/ts-in-depth
> webpack -d --watch

ts-loader: Using typescript@2.1.4 and /home/craiskin/ws/ts/ts-in-depth/tsconfig.json
Hash: 06385a13cdad52c456c6
Version: webpack 1.14.0
Time: 1841ms
             Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    ./js/bundle.js   2.4 kB       0  [emitted]  main
./js/bundle.js.map  2.54 kB       0  [emitted]  main
    + 1 hidden modules
```

and

    2. To run the lite-server:

```
$ npm start
```



#### Initial Setup

Put project folder under npm control

```
$ npm init
```

creates package.json.



#### To set up dev environment

To be able to use RxJS v5, I need  EcmaScript 2015 (ES6) environment.
So, I need a transpiler to transpile our code into ES5 code so that it can 
execute in the browser today.
I also need a module bundler to package all of our code and to serve it up to
the browser.

webpack - will build and package our code into a single file.

  webpack-dev-server - dev web server
  typescript - compiler   
  typings 
  ts-loader - a plugin for webpack enabling typescript with webpack 


```
$ npm install webpack webpack-dev-server typescript typings ts-loader --save-de
v

```


##### configure typescript compiler

create `tsconfig.json` file
with the following options:

  target: ES5
  module: commonjs - that's the module format that webpack understands
  sourceMap: true - yes, create the sourceMap - makes it easier to debug

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "sourceMap": true
  }
}
```


##### configure webpack tool

create `webpack.config.js` - a javascript file that webpack will execute in 
nodejs environment.  and this file needs to export a configuration object specifying:

  entry point for my application - which file bootstraps my application
  single output - app.js - that will be loaded in index.html
  module loaders - in our case just one `ts-loader` for all .ts files in our project.
  how webpack should resolve modules - what file extensions to look for. 

```
module.exports = {
  entry: "./app",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js"
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      { 
        test: /\.ts$/, 
        loader: "ts-loader" }
    ]
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ["", ".ts", ".js"]
  }
};

```

NOTE: webpack creates resources in memory - you won't see `bundle.js` anywhere 
in the filesystem.

#### add scripts

Add npm `start` script in `package.json` file:

```
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --watch --inline"
``` 

This will allow the webpack to watch for file changes and refresh when a change 
is detected.

`postinstall` script to be run after npm is finished with an install

```
    "postinstall": "typings install"
```

this will make sure that anyone who start this project from source code from
scratch and runs `npm install`  will also install typings correctly.
This will be the `es6-shim` typings file that we installed earlier.


#### run the webpack dev server

```

$ npm start

> ps-rxjs5@1.0.0 start ./js/ps-rxjs5
> webpack-dev-server --watch --inline
