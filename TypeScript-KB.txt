Variables
---------

primary difference between var and let/const is in the scoping rules.

var
    Variables declared with 'var' are globally available in the function in which they are declared.
    Even if a variable is nested levels deep...

    Variables declared with 'var' are hoisted to the top of the function in which they are declared.



let

const    

    variables declared with 'let' and 'const' are only available in the block in which they are declared
    not 'hoisted' to the top of the block/container where they are declared.

    variable can be declared by the same name again in the same function where it is already declared.


Basic Types
-----------

  Boolean

  Number
    floating-point type (just like js)

    function returnNumber(): number {
      return 42;
    }


  String

    let myString: string = 'this is a string';

  Array  
    can specify type of the array elements

  Enum


  Any
    any type
    avoid using this type

  Void
    specifies absence of a type.   Function return type.


TypeScript Inference
--------------------

TypeScript infers the type based on the assignment.
  let myString = 'this is a string';    
Avoid Inference.
