                All usages of the symbol will be renamed in all files.

  Debug
  *****

Debug Button   => configure icon (gear icon) at the top of the screen.
Select "NodeJS" as your debug environment.
That will create another file to your project - launch.json

Look at the launch configurations in launch.json

"program" says which file to debug (e.g. app.ts)
"sourceMaps" true - tell the debug to look for the JS file
"outDir": "js" identifies the directory where source maps are located.
"externalConsole": true - would open a new terminal to which the debug will go.

"preLaunchTask": "someTask"


After configuring..
Launch the debugger with "green arrow" at the top of the debugger pane (F5)

    Settings
    ********

VS Code provides two different scopes for settings:

User
    these settings apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open

Settings File Locations

    Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:

    Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
    Mac $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json

Workspace
    these settings are stored inside your workspace in a .vscode folder and only apply when the workspace is opened. Settings defined on this scope overwrite the user scope.
